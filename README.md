lider: discover overgrown landscapes you just want to be in.

## run locally

```bash
npx vite
```
Then open <http://localhost:5173/>

## main ideas

  - creating living and breathing spaces that are chill, have different feels, high variety (sounds and objects)
  - spaces are enclosed (bushes you can walk through, veins, waterfalls etc)
  - no creatures attack you
  - breathing, fluid seasons (depending on space), day-night cycle, wind, storm, upwind, downwind, sand storm, thicker air, lighter air
  - a physical movement set that allows exploring and isn't punishing
  - pacing is more important than immersion

## inspirations

  - [gris](https://nomada.studio/gris-game/)
  - [Monogatari Series Second Season](https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Monogatari_Series_Second_Season) (you'll be fine not watching others first)
  - [proteus](https://twistedtreegames.com/proteus/)
  - [ABZ√õ](https://abzugame.com/)

## graphics ideas

  - square tree going spiraling inwards like a staircase
  - rotating leave parts
  - trees turning like wind wheels in the wind
  - fully round trees

## side ideas

  - based on stamina, hunger, thirst, damage, emotion, impatience ...
      - failed/opposite/bad/wrong actions
      - perspective (rotation, field of view, height, colors, screen shake, blur, ...)
      - view area gets bigger for higher speeds
  - shadows growing ever longer or are changing side
  - adaptive music with microtonal drips on flap
  - sleep times of certain creatures, assembly of creatures, sporing times, growth periods
  - emergent change of environment and complex behavior patterns

## cutscene ideas

- when landing on an object, everything else collapses
- shapes stripped of unique aspects, losing detail

## conversation ideas

Player selects dialog options even for characters <BIRD> speaks with


Thoughts of characters are displayed above their heads
  - with pretty opaque colored background
  - bold, styled, distorted, hypnotic
  - emotions like _doubt_, _anxiety_, _hope_, _despair_, sometimes using emotes https://www.emotes.io/?unicode
  - colors like _yellow_, _black_, _grey_ (the blandest and most deep color of all)
  - intentionally too short on screen to read fully, not repeatable, to make you kind of frustrated you missed the lore
  - sometimes _~_ wave if no thoughts

Repeated transitions, like _ ___ da daa da, da-dam!_

  - characters sometimes refer to your answers, even if you haven't even talked to them
  - first NPC
      - <INTRODUCTION>
        is it just just me or has my home's population just increased?
      - <BIRD> [no options] people don't reply to rhetorical Qs.
      - <INTRODUCTION>
        don't be so stiff
      - <BIRD>
          - | how are you?
          - | more like who wants to know that
      - <INTRODUCTION>
        _>u<      eey!_
        TODO
      - <BIRD>
        _‡≤†_‡≤†_
          - | sup
          - | use {table plant}
              - <BIRD> I don't have {table plant}.
      - <INTRODUCTION>
        Here, take `5` {glass nuggets}
        _Hey ####, where you come from?._
        that's precisely what you need.
      - <BIRD> where you got the gubbins from
        _and where's the package?_
      - <INTRODUCTION>
        I need `5` {glass nuggets}.
        _go cough em back up_
      - <BIRD>
          - | stop bothering me
          - | what your fav place here
      - <INTRODUCTION>
        mountains
        _ìÜ±ìÜ≠ìÜÆ my mountains, my home_
        don't you know what's going in these lands?
        _¬∞‚Äø‚Äø¬∞_
        _subject: shut up_
        _sender: me_
        _if this question makes you uncomfortable, please hit skip to continue_
      - | <BIRD> skip interview
      - <INTRODUCTION>
        cmon, it's a quickie
        what are you going to do later today?
        what do you like about going on long ####s in the evening?
        have you been practicing #####?
        how come that each day which resembles the last just bores you?
        do you blame on the lack of change?
      - <BIRD>
        nah sorry I just wanna play. it's time for a goodbye, pal
      - <INTRODUCTION>
        indeed
        _Gem√ºsestand mit Selbstbediehnung #implied#_
        just play the game.
        And I don't want you to call me pal. And bye.
  - "hypothetical"
      - <BUOY>
        Here's a hypothetical: 2 others can be saved if you die
      - | <BIRD> too little data. i refuse to answer, buddy
          - <BUOY> limiting info is the point of hypotheticals
      - | <BIRD> then me ded of course
      - | <BIRD> i fear death
          - <INTRODUCTION> sorry to break it to you, you will die
      - | <BIRD> nobody has the right to kill themselves
          - <INTRODUCTION>
            that a religious thing?
            would it be fine if someone else killed you on your choice/principles?
      - | <BIRD>
        i can assure i will on average do more do good then 2 randomly chosen peops ever could
        half of peops have rotten brains.
        it's not as hard to be above average in bringing good
          - <INTRODUCTION>
            i trust you're doing the right thing.
            frankly, the only thing i can see is that on average, more than average claim their above average...
            _that doesn't mean much but ##### hate it_
            make sure to always be on track with data
            there's surprisingly much we individuals don't know
  - unlearning convo
      - <BIRD>
        Finally, you can teach me something can't you?
      - <UNSTUDENTIZER>
        I much rather listen to everyone that comes by but if you're looking for a way to proceed, listen up.
        This game is not about change. Nowhere you have to go, no "making progress", no learning to fly or finding yourself or some bull.
        Wander out and about or stay where you like it and just be.
        Not saying I wish there wasn't change.
  - convo with POINTIL
      - <POINTIL>
        can i hear you?
        are you here?
        when is now?
        can i see you?
        i'm pointil. Do you know your name?
          - <BIRD> yes. You know something I don't know or you just crazy lil point?
      - <POINTIL>
        First, i just simply tell you what i say!
        Second, i just know what i know. What's so wrong about that!
        I have to repeat?
        _said pointil while standing on a leaf_
        _scene 12_
        _unnumbered scene_
        _pandas standing in a circle around a sand pit_
        _89 seconds       i like that one_
        _next, no commercials_
  - time travel hypothetical convo ‚Äì on knowledge 0
      - <TRAVE>
        do you know these cheesy time travel stories,
        like traveling back in time to prevent causing bad things
        but later traveling back in time to not prevent causing bad things to restore good things that were caused by bad things
        then being too afraid to travel in time anymore
      - <BIRD>
        i take it that because of fear they limited time travel to as few times as possible?
      - <TRAVE>
        i realized the same applies to us right now
        impact of actions must be undermined by an equal amount of proof/knowledge
  - on harm 0
      - <TRAVE>
        imagine a box of every good thing.
        then taking out the worst things until only one item is left.
        what you got?
      - <BIRD>
        | various pure forms of emotions like human care, respect and appreciation
          - <TRAVE>
            interesting. And a very sweet thing to say
            Want a hug?
          - <BIRD>
            | ( ‚ó°ÃÅ.‚ó°ÃÄ)\(^‚ó°^ )
            | I'll keep that offer in mind for when I need it, thank u
        | something religious
          - <TRAVE>
            sounds like everything i've ever looked for
            also sounds too good to be true
            since we can never know something for sure i wouldn't bank on that
            but if we only hoping all's good!
        | u trying to say that every good thing has strings attached?
          - <TRAVE>
            i mean i guess we agree that all actions necessarily cause harm which will keep the world from being rid of non-happiness.
            doesn't mean much but hey
  - undecided convo

        should have been more specific bruh
      - <OKE>
        Anyway,

  - NPCs give small hints of sadness and anger towards BIRD in previous conversations
      - where did <...> go? and _other euphemisms for death of acquaintances_
  - <BIRD>
    i want to live
    ...
    i'm damn hungry

      - BIRD can fend off eating others multiple times
      - <REN> does recognize your appearance but thinks you might just be disguised as you
          - <BIRD> TODO you try to reason with them that you're the real 
      - BIRD only comes to know BIRD has eaten multiple others later like from the same species as REN
      - <BIRDFATHER>
        just ate. please clean up the {blood}. Then we can talk
        TODO convo
      - <BIRD> 
        oh
        that's brutally sad
        no matter what i do i hurt others more than i bring happiness
        and didn't i end a ton of lives just by having lived up until this point?
        _?_
        how come i never noticed
        _???_
        i knew i had the desire to

  - <NARRATOR>
    (TODO into dialog) points you to hopeful stuff prominent in safe spots etc in the world and tells you some other sad peep did this.
    Later gets caught by the player placing symbols like that hopeful thing.
    When it breaks down it hurts more
  - rule of thumb
    for every viewpoint you adapt you must be able to define a line where you step back from it
    otherwise it becomes like a religion and you like a useful tool
  - TODO include scarf = neck carpet, bouquet = tares, water = fried snow
  - TODO include This works most of the time... . . . so let's just round that up to all of the time and continue
  - ? names of characters and you change in first minor, sometimes major way based on influence and feelings
